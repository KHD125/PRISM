    # HARDCODED CLAIM (fixed 2026-08-25): this card's subtitle was the literal string
    # "-7-8% Active Perimeter Shield" — a number stated as if measured but never computed. It is
    # true for 95 of 2,117 stocks (4.5%); the real distance spans -20% to +27% (p10-p90). On EPack
    # Prefab it read "-7-8%" while the stop sat 25.5% BELOW the price, and the card immediately to
    # its right correctly said "+34.2% vs stop" — the same row contradicting itself. Compute it.
    # ~26% of the universe trades AT or BELOW its stop, where a negative "distance" would be a lie
    # in the other direction, so that state gets its own wording.
    # A STOP ABOVE THE PRICE IS NOT A STOP (fixed 2026-08-25). A stop-loss is the level you exit
    # at to cap a loss, so it must sit BELOW the position — one above the price would trigger
    # instantly. A volatility stop flips to the short side once price breaks down, so for 876
    # stocks (41.4% of the universe, every one "🔻 Below Stop (Trend Broken)") this card printed
    # a short-side level under a long-side label: Avanti Feeds, price ₹861.40, headline
    # "HARD VOLATILITY STOP-LOSS LEVEL ₹1,153.36". The number is real — it is the level price must
    # RECLAIM — but calling it your stop is wrong, so the label changes with the state.
    #
    # It also states the gap from the SAME side as the price card. The first version of this
    # subtitle recomputed the distance against the price ((vstop-close)/close) while the price
    # card uses the engine's dist_to_vstop ((close-vstop)/vstop), so one screen showed "33.9%
    # ABOVE price" and "-25.3% vs stop" for a single gap — arithmetically fine, visibly
    # contradictory. Mirror the engine's column instead of inventing a second denominator.

    Mounted beneath the Mauboussin radar. Defensive: all values via _g()/_esc(), float-guarded.
