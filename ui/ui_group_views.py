ui_group_views.py — the measures behind the Market Pulse 📈 Sectors and 🏭 Industry column views.

ONE DEFINITION FOR BOTH TABS (2026-10-05): what each column measures, how a GROUP of stocks is
summarised, and the header and tooltip it carries. Pure pandas, no Streamlit, so it is tested
directly (tests/test_market_pulse_views.py).

HOW A GROUP IS SUMMARISED
  mean    PRISM's own 0-100 scores — an average of percentile scores is well behaved.
  median  raw multiples and distances (P/E, EV/EBITDA, FCF yield, distance from the 52-week high):
          one P/E of 900 drags an average anywhere; the middle stock is the honest summary.
  net     ownership changes (the FII / DII stake, latest filed quarter): the % of the group's companies
          where the stake rose minus the % where it fell, among companies with a reading (−100 to
          +100). An average or median of the changes themselves is flat — most companies do not move
          in a quarter (FII 31% / DII 36% flat) — so who moved, and which way, is what reads.
  share   yes/no conditions (above the 200-day average, few red flags): the % of the group's stocks
          for which it holds, counted ONLY among stocks that have the data — an unknown is not a "no".
          The engine records some unknowns as 0 — a stock with no 200-day average yet is "not above"
          it, one with no cash-flow figure "not flagged" for accruals — so those measures name the
          inputs they NEED, and a stock missing one is left out. Measured 2026-10-05: counting the 180
          stocks with no 200-day average as "below" read Engineering Heavy General 45% above its
          200-DMA when 83% of the stocks that have one are (23 industries moved 10 points or more).
          Composite verdicts — the red-flag count, Schilit pass, the F-Score — are the engine's own.

WHY THESE COLUMNS. Measured on 2026-10-05 across 67 sectors (>= 5 stocks) and 252 industries (>= 3):
no two columns in one view rank-correlate at 0.85 or more, and none is flat. Dropped on that test:
median ROCE (0.90 with Quality), earnings yield (-0.99 with P/E — it is 1/P/E), % at the forensic
penalty floor (0.90 with the average red-flag count), RS score (0.96 with Momentum), breakout score
(0.90 with the distance from the 52-week high), the median 52-week relative strength against the
Nifty 500 (0.85 with % above the 200-day average, which overlaps less with the rest of the view),
and dividend yield / pledge (median 0 almost everywhere). Momentum lives in Core, so 📈 Technical carries breadth (% above the 200-day average,
0.89 with Momentum) instead of repeating it.

👥 OWNERSHIP (2026-10-05), measured on the four saved snapshots: inside the view no pair passes 0.50
(median promoter vs median FII+DII), and against everything else on screen the closest is FII net vs
average Momentum at 0.52. DISPLAY ONLY — the forward evidence is weak: across four windows, sectors
with more pledging returned less (−0.09 to −0.15) and less institutionally owned sectors more (−0.10
to −0.32, mostly surviving a size control); FII net was positive, but about a third of it is Momentum.
Pledge is a SHARE here (any pledge), not the median, which is 0 almost everywhere. Insider trading
(10% coverage) is left out.
