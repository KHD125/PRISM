    Used by the sidebar 📥 download (the Cloud-side snapshot) AND tools/snapshot.py (the local
    one), so the archive in Drive and the archive on disk are the same file. The vintage — not
    today's date — is the identity of a snapshot: the data only changes when the sheet is
    refreshed, so two snapshots of one vintage under one engine are identical and a download
    named by the day it was clicked mislabels it. Pure — never mutates `df`.

    scored_mode ADDED 2026-09-19, the day the default moved Hybrid -> Breakout. Without it a
    snapshot is an orphan: tools/validate.py has to BACK OUT the framework boosts to compare
    weightings, and that arithmetic needs the weights the composite was actually built from —
    guessing "Hybrid" would silently mis-reconstruct every snapshot taken after the switch.
