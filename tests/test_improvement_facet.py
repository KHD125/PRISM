"""Contract: the IMPROVEMENT facet of quality_score — is the business getting BETTER, over the LAST YEAR?

WHY IT EXISTS (2026-10-03). quality_score was built almost entirely from LEVELS and long histories
(10-year ROCE/ROE medians, 5-year margin medians, 5/10-year growth). A study of the next three years'
winners said the level carried almost nothing and the recent CHANGE carried the signal. Measured on a
one-off StockScans export (Returns 1Y/3Y CAGR, verified against the snapshot and known prices),
traits known at the START of each window:

    trait at the start               3Y Oct23->26   1Y Oct25->26 (falling market)
    profit growth, 2y before            +0.173          +0.186
    margin widening, 2y before          +0.138          +0.190
    margin LEVEL at start               +0.015          +0.129
    P/E at start                        -0.003            -

It held in small, mid AND large companies, and was never negative in any cyclicality tier (deep
cyclicals ~0 over 3 years — the Lynch peak-margin trap was looked for and not found). Whole-market
ranking was kept on measurement: within-sector/industry ranking lost signal without fixing deep cyclicals.

THE DESIGN: LAST-YEAR CHANGES, EQUAL THIRDS (revised the same day it first shipped).
The first version (commit 3671312) used profit growth over TWO years + the 1-year margin change. A
follow-up asked which of OPM / GPM / NPM / PAT / Revenue / EBITDA the facet needs, and the answer was a
single rule — RECENCY: for every measure, the last year's change beat the 2-year change in both long
windows (and a 2-year margin span beat a 4-year one, +0.190 vs +0.120). Head-to-head, rank-IC:

    design                                        3Y      1Y (falling)   short 66d   short 28d
    shipped: profit 2y + margin                +0.169      +0.205       +0.065      +0.110
    THIS:    profit 1y + revenue 1y + margin 1y +0.223      +0.271       +0.093      +0.147

Inside quality at 20%, in EXACT engine form: default mode +0.146/+0.101 -> +0.148/+0.104, Fundamental
+0.121/+0.015 -> +0.127/+0.022. Quintiles rise as a clean staircase (3Y: -0.4, +1.9, +3.8, +9.3, +16.8 %/yr).
(The long windows could only test the 1-year MARGIN leg via NPM — no OPM 2 or 4 years back exists; OPM
is used live because NPM is redundant here, see below.)

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN IT:
  * NPM change — NPM = PAT / revenue, so with profit growth AND revenue growth both in, the NPM change is
    already determined by them (NPM_now / NPM_1yb = (1+profit growth) / (1+revenue growth)).
  * EBITDA growth — EBITDA ~ revenue x OPM, so its growth is revenue growth + margin change, both in
    (overlap +0.75); and only ebitda / ebitda_1yb exist, so it cannot be tested on a long window.
  * GPM change — no full-year gross margin exists at all (quarterly only, and only since 2026-09-18).
  * ROCE change — the vendor half-updated `roce` to the new fiscal year (changed on 61% of rows June ->
    September, rolled into roce_1yb on 1.3%) while roce_1yb / roce_2yb stayed frozen, so any ROCE delta
    today compares mismatched years (CLAUDE.md §5 cross-year basis rule). Rule: add it after the balance
    sheet rolls ONLY if it adds >= +0.01 on top of this facet (today +0.003 / +0.001).
  * A turnaround bonus — a loss year has no growth RATE (forward edge measured -0.2 / +0.2pp), so it is
    no evidence, not a reward.

20% is a prior, not a fit: 30% scored slightly higher and choosing it would be fitting two windows.
The six level facets are scaled by 0.8 each, so levels stay in — margin LEVEL still helped in the
falling year (+0.129).
