"""Contract: the cyclicality columns — max_earnings_drawdown_5y + cyclicality_tier.

⚠️ SCOPE OF THE BYTE-IDENTICAL TEST BELOW (clarified 2026-08-24). It poisons these columns AFTER
fetch_and_clean_data has run, so it proves only that NOTHING DOWNSTREAM OF THE DATA STAGE reads
them. It does NOT prove the columns are score-free: within the data stage, cyclicality_tier caps
fair_pe_qglp at 18.0 for 'Deep Cyclical / Commodity' (data_engine ~L3672), and that flows into
pe_discount_to_quality → the valuation axis → composite_score. Measured 2026-08-24: re-tiering ONE
industry AT SOURCE moved 28 stocks' composite_score (max 0.28 pts), spilling to sector peers via the
sector-relative rank. Re-tier only behind /census + /verify.

Two columns shipped into compute_derived_signals (core/data_engine.py); no consumer downstream of
the data stage scores them (pinned by the byte-identical composite test below):

  max_earnings_drawdown_5y — deepest TIME-ORDERED peak-to-trough fall in annual PAT over the 6
      available years (current + 5 back). A monotone compounder scores ~0; a commodity that
      collapsed at the trough scores high; >1.0 = the trough went negative. NaN when <4 of 6 present.
  cyclicality_tier(_code) — the a-priori business TYPE from the committed core/cyclicality_map.py
      (industry → sector fallback → "F"). The FINER, industry-level DISPLAY sibling of the
      SECTOR-level cyclical_peak_trap (which DOES feed scoring). Prior(tier) vs realized(drawdown)
      disagreement is itself the signal.

The COMMITTED map (not a runtime CSV read) is what makes this deploy-safe. The coverage guard is
SPLIT (mirroring the project's committed-test / live-ritual pattern): the synthetic miss-detection
below is committed (passes in a code-only CI clone with no data); the LIVE count-of-unmapped==0
tripwire lives in tools/verify.py, where the gitignored real CSV exists.

# ── vendor-known industries that no live stock carries YET (2026-09-19) ────────────
# WHY THESE EXIST, so nobody prunes them as dead entries. The generator builds INDUSTRY_TIER from
# the LIVE universe, so an industry could only ever be tiered AFTER a stock already carried it --
# meaning the first stock in a new industry scored against a sector fallback (or the runtime
# .fillna("F")) until somebody noticed tools/verify.py tripping and re-ran the generator. The
# generator now UNIONS the vendor's own market-scan industry list into its input, which closes that
# one-regeneration lag; classify() is a pure function of the NAME and needs no stock to run.
#
# On the day the union landed, 13 of the vendor's 238 names had zero live stocks -- twelve
# lenders/insurers/AMCs and Music Licensing. That is not random: this universe contains NO BANKS AT
# ALL (HDFC Bank, ICICI, SBI, Axis, Kotak, Bajaj Finance all absent), a deliberate exclusion,
# because a lender has no OPM, no inventory, no CCC and a meaningless D/E.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES *NOT* CLAIM: tiering a bank does not make PRISM able to score one. It means only
# that IF a lender ever enters the universe, its cyclicality tier is correct on arrival instead of
# one regeneration later. Verified at the time: adding all 13 re-tiered ZERO existing industries,
# left SECTOR_TIER_FALLBACK byte-identical, and moved composite_score / rank / gate_pass /
# conviction_tier / fair_pe_qglp on exactly 0 of 2,717 rows -- which is guaranteed by construction,
# since no stock carries any of these names.
