"""Contract for the Deep Scanner CSV export — the 📥 download button in app.py `with tabs[1]:`.
Pins two regressions the 2026-06-20 audit surfaced:

  1. The export must encode via ui_export._to_csv_bytes (UTF-8 BOM) so its emoji decision-columns
     (moat_growth_quad ⭐💀, smart_money_flow ⚪✅❌, weinstein_stage, buy_zone_label) render in Excel
     instead of mojibake — the sibling sidebar full-dump export already does exactly this.
  2. Every column the _DS_VIEWS presets surface (== the export's deduped union) must exist on the real
     scored frame, or it silently drops from BOTH the on-screen table and the export, with the button's
     "{n} columns" count quietly wrong and no error raised.

app.py's tab body is Streamlit runtime code (not unit-renderable), so finding #1 is pinned by a precise
AST check on the Deep Scanner block — the same house style as test_app_imports / test_tooltip_coverage.
