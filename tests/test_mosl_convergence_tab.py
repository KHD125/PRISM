test_mosl_convergence_tab.py
============================
Contract for the Market Pulse → 🔭 MOSL tab: how many of the 10 Motilal Oswal Wealth Creation
lenses (studies 16–30) a stock clears at once.

WHY THIS VIEW IS LEGITIMATE WHERE A GENERIC ONE IS NOT. A count across all 37 frameworks would be
meaningless: gate strictness varies BY DESIGN and the code says so — Dhandho fires on 1 stock
because Pabrai Ch.10 mandates "Few Bets, Big Bets, Infrequent Bets", CAN SLIM on 2 because
O'Neil's all-seven rule is that strict, while Schilit Clean fires on 62.5% because it is a
cleanliness check rather than a screen. Putting those side by side invites the reader to compare
numbers that are not comparable. The MOSL lenses come from ONE research programme, so agreement
between them means something.

THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS FOR — and it caught the author first. `frameworks_passed` is a
", "-joined string, and **"QGLP" is a SUBSTRING of "SQGLP Century Stock"**. A first measurement
used `.str.contains` and pulled 37 extra stocks into the cohort, which then produced WRONG caveat
figures (5 median flags and 83.6% AVOID instead of the true 6 and 80.6%). Exact-token splitting is
not a style preference here; it is the difference between right and wrong numbers.

THE SIGNAL IS REAL, and was checked before the tab was built:
    convergence distribution is a clean pyramid  — 0:999 … 4:99 … 8:1
    corr(convergence, composite_score) = 0.479   — informative, nowhere near redundant

THE CAVEAT IS LOAD-BEARING. The 4+ cohort carries a MEDIAN OF 6 RED FLAGS against the universe's
5 — slightly worse, not better — and 80.6% of it is AVOID. These lenses gate quality, growth and
longevity; none reads the forensics. The tab says so in its caption rather than a tooltip, and
these tests pin that it keeps saying so.
