======================
Contract for the Market Pulse → Sectors filter row.

FIVE CONTROLS, TWO KINDS — and the difference is invisible on screen, which is why it is pinned
here rather than left to whoever edits this next:

    RE-AGGREGATING   Market-cap tier, Wealth Tier, Cyclicality tier (returned 2026-08-28 —
                     measured: 42 of 81 sectors hold >1 tier, so only a stock filter can answer
                     "sector rankings among Defensive stocks"; the 2026-08-27 swap had quietly
                     lost that view)
                     filter the STOCKS, so every average and % Qualify is recomputed
    ROW FILTERS      Capital phase, Min stocks/sector
                     hide whole sectors and leave the survivors' numbers untouched

REPLACED 2026-08-27 (user request): the re-aggregating slot held Cyclicality tier; it now holds
the Wealth Tier. Same semantics, same slot, so every behavioural contract below carries over.
Cyclicality filtering still exists in the Discovery sidebar (sb_cyc) — no capability was lost.

Four identical-looking controls that behave in two different ways is a trap. The tests below
assert the behaviour, not the label.

MULTI-SELECT + CASCADE 2026-08-30 (user request). The four set-membership controls became
multiselects driven by the shared `_mp_ms` helper: several values each (OR within a control, AND
across), options and live counts computed from the frame already narrowed by the controls to the
left. Every semantic above survives the change — what moved is `== scalar` → `.isin(list)` and
`"All"` → `[]` as the neutral state. THE UNITS ARE THE NEW HAZARD, and they are pinned below: a
re-aggregating filter's count is STOCKS (what gets re-averaged), a row filter's count is SECTORS
(the rows it hides). One number, two possible meanings, is the "100% trap" class again.

The size dial stays a SELECTBOX: it is a numeric threshold, not a set.

WHY THE SIZE DIAL EXISTS, and why it is the important one. The floor was hardcoded at 5, and that
is precisely why the ranking was dominated by tiny sectors: an extreme % Qualify is easy at n=7
and near-impossible at n=96. Measured 2026-08-27 — 8 of the top 10 sectors held fewer than 12
stocks (median 9 against 19 universe-wide), and Glass & Glass Products ranked #1 at 88% on 8
stocks while carrying a below-average composite of 27.9. Raising the floor to 15 changes the top
six COMPLETELY: 0 of 6 in common. The tab's own tooltip already warned about this; now it can be
acted on.

DEFAULT STAYS 5, so the tab is byte-identical for anyone who does not touch the control.
