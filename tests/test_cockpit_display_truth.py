test_cockpit_display_truth.py
=============================
Contracts for the Matrix & WCS tab's display truth — three bugs found by reading the rendered
tab for EPack Prefab Technologies on 2026-08-25, all of the same family: a card stating
something the engine never computed.

1. HARDCODED STOP DISTANCE. The stop-loss card's subtitle was the literal string
   "-7-8% Active Perimeter Shield" — a number presented as measurement but never derived. True
   for 95 of 2,117 stocks (4.5%); the real distance spans -20%..+27% (p10-p90). EPack rendered
   "-7-8%" while its stop sat 25.5% BELOW the price, with the card immediately to its right
   correctly reading "+34.2% vs stop" — one row contradicting itself.

2. FABRICATED ZEROS. `value_creation_velocity` (96.0% populated) and `expectations_gap` (68.4%)
   were read with a 0.0 default, so 669 stocks were shown a confident "+0.00%" for a number
   nobody had. A data hole is not a measurement (CLAUDE.md §5).

3. EP LABEL. "✅ EP Positive" carried a green check on 285 of its 299 rows whose economic profit
   was SHRINKING (the other 14 have no prior-year figure; zero are flat or rising) — rendered
   directly beside "EP VELOCITY ₹-12 Cr Descending ↓". Renamed "➖ EP Positive, Not Rising".
   The taxonomy was always sound: "🚀 Hockey Stick" is 0-for-533 on negative velocity.
