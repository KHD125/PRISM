==========================
Contract for the column VIEWS on Market Pulse → 📈 Sectors and 🏭 Industry (2026-10-05):
🏆 Core · 📊 Quality · 💰 Valuation · 🔬 Forensic · 📈 Technical · 👥 Ownership — the Deep Scanner's
views, so there is one vocabulary in the app.

WHY. Both tables had outgrown the screen: at a 1536px viewport Sectors carried 1,292px of content in
995px and Industry 1,567px, so Momentum, Valuation and the dominant sector sat behind a sideways
scroll. Views show five or six columns at a time, and they make room for what a sector table could
not show at all — breadth above the 200-day average, the median P/E, the average red-flag count.

WHAT IS PINNED, each a way this breaks silently:
  1. HOW a group is summarised (ui/ui_group_views.py): 0-100 scores by MEAN, raw multiples by
     MEDIAN (one P/E of 900 must not move a sector), yes/no conditions as a SHARE counted only among
     stocks with the data (an unknown is not a "no" — INCLUDING the unknowns the engine records as 0:
     no 200-day average yet, no cash-flow figure; the first draft's toy wrote them as NaN, which the
     engine never does, so it passed while 180 recent listings were counted "below"), and the "few
     red flags" line read from the forensic penalty tiers, never retyped.
  2. Both tables receive the measures from the SAME filtered stocks as their other columns — and
     🏭 Industry's fixed column list carries every input (that list crashed this tab once already).
  3. Every view leads with Count and the tab's ranking column, so the order always makes sense:
     switching views changes the COLUMNS, never the RANKING. Industry keeps its sector last.
  4. Every column on screen has a header — none renders as a raw snake_case name.
  5. The view is a display choice, not a filter: 🧹 Clear never resets it.
  6. On live data no two columns in one view move together (rank correlation < 0.85) and none is
     flat — the test that chose them (2026-10-05) dropped median ROCE (0.90 with Quality), earnings
     yield (-0.99 with P/E), % at the penalty floor (0.90 with average red flags), RS score (0.96
     with Momentum), breakout score (0.90 with distance from the high), the median 52-week RS
     (0.85 with % above the 200-day average — found by THIS file's live test, which the first
     measurement never paired), dividend yield and pledge (median 0 almost everywhere).
  7. 👥 OWNERSHIP (2026-10-05), in all three places: each group measure on a toy where every column
     carries an unknown; net breadth = % raised − % cut among companies WITH a reading; the note that
     shareholding is filed quarterly shows with the view and only with it; per stock, each stake sits
     beside its change, changes read in percentage points, and the tips are the glossary's own.
