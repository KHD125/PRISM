"""Off ATH (🔎 Deep Scanner, 📈 Technical): the distance to the all-time high, beside the breakout pair.

From ValuePickr's 52-week / all-time-high thread. Measured 2026-10-05 on the four saved snapshots
(corporate actions excluded), with the bar declared before measuring (>= +0.03 beyond Breakout and
Momentum in every window): the all-time-high distance added +0.051 / +0.049 / +0.037 / +0.054 to
forward rank-IC beyond the Breakout AND Momentum scores, more than any column the Technical view
already showed (RSI, Stop and 52-week RS added -0.03 to +0.07). It already feeds the Breakout score
(BREAKOUT_SIGNALS["ath_distance"]), so it is UNDER-weighted there, not missing: the column shows it,
and its weight is December's question (docs/december-2026-plan.md rule 15).

The sector half (📈 Sectors' Near 52w high) is pinned in tests/test_market_pulse_views.py.
