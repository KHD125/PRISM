test_market_pulse_scope.py
==========================
Contract: the 🎯 scope checkbox — Market Pulse's ONE control for pointing every lens at the
sidebar cohort instead of the whole market.

WHY IT EXISTS (2026-09-20, user request). Market Pulse has always read the module-level `df` and
ignored the sidebar, with four captions saying so. That made "which sectors dominate the list I am
actually considering" unanswerable — a real question, and one Deep Scanner and Discovery already
answer, since both read `filt`. The checkbox makes market-wide a CHOICE instead of a property.

MEASURED BEFORE BUILDING, because the obvious objection was statistical and it turned out to be
wrong. I expected filtering to destroy these tabs — to rank the FILTER rather than the sectors.
It does not: the between-sector spread in average composite HOLDS as filters tighten
(SD 5.65 no-filter → 6.42 gate-passed → 5.88 BUY★+BUY → 6.53 BUY★). The ranking keeps its
information. What filtering really costs is SAMPLE, and that is what the guards below address:

    sidebar state    stocks   sectors with >=5   industries with >=5
    no filter         2,717          67                 155
    Gate passed         876          46                  57
    BUY★ only           331          24                   9
    Conviction <=2       20           1                   0

THE FOUR INVARIANTS, each pinned below:

  1. DEFAULT OFF, AND INVISIBLE WHEN IDLE. The checkbox materialises only while
     `0 < len(filt) < len(df)`. Both ends are load-bearing: with no sidebar filter there is
     nothing to limit to and the control is furniture (the 🧹 Clear rule the lens row already
     follows), and with a filter matching NOTHING "show only my filtered stocks" is a dead screen.
     An unfiltered session sees the pre-existing screen down to the byte.

  2. THE VITALS BAND IS NEVER SCOPED. Breadth of a shortlist is not breadth: "87% of my 20
     filtered stocks are above their 200DMA" is a statement about the shortlist, printed where a
     reader goes for the market. `render_pulse_band` keeps taking the full `df`, always.

  3. NO CAPTION CONTRADICTS THE CONTROL. Four captions hardcoded "Market-wide (ignores sidebar
     filters)". With scoping on that sentence denies the checkbox directly above it — the
     caption-drift class this app shipped twice in one day (the Breakout mode's "the default stays
     Hybrid", the composite formula line). One helper, `_mp_scope_cap()`, derives it.

  4. THE AGGREGATING TABS STATE THEIR SAMPLE. 📈 Sectors and 🏭 Industry average rather than list,
     and an average over one stock is that stock wearing a group's name — filtering to BUY★ leaves
     15 of 59 sectors whose "average" IS a single company (Ceramic Products, 68.2, n=1). 🏭
     Industry has NO min-stocks dial and 32% of its industries sit at <=2 stocks even unfiltered,
     so it needs the number most. Below 3 surviving groups the line becomes a warning that names
     both exits rather than a table that reads like a ranking.

MOVERS IS SCOPED THROUGH restrict(), NEVER THROUGH THE INPUT FRAME. compute_movers diffs two
vintages; pre-filtering the current side would turn every excluded stock into a fake "dropped"
row (guarded in ui_movers.restrict, whose docstring says so). The scope feeds the LENS ROW, whose
output still goes through restrict() after the diff.
