"""Docs drift from the engine SILENTLY — pin the vocabulary the same way the code is pinned.

Measured 2026-09-09: docs/handbook/ had drifted from the engine in thirteen days and nothing
said so. The COUNTS were all correct (28 red flags, 37 frameworks); the NAMING had rotted —
ch07 documented the headline call as BUY/WATCH/AVOID after the 2026-08-27 rename to
SOUND/MIXED/FLAWED (itself pinned, for code, by tests/test_verdict_vocabulary.py), and the
whole wealth ladder was undocumented while ch07 used that layer's action words for a different
layer. Three defects, none caught by 2731 green tests, because no test read the prose.

Scope is docs/handbook/ deliberately. docs/user-guide/ carries the same drift (02-discovery-tab
and 10-faq still present BUY/WATCH/AVOID as current; two files describe the display-retired
verdict_strength as live) but that prose is the user's to edit — logged in docs/known-issues.md
instead of enforced here.

docs/ is gitignored (private handover), so these skip when it is absent — same pattern as the
stockscans_sync boundary pin.
