test_moat_tau_quantization.py
=============================
Contract: `moat_tau` is QUANTIZED, and the wealth tier's C/FADE gates depend on the attainable
value set — which is a function of HOW MANY OPM LEVEL COLUMNS the ladder holds.

HISTORY (2026-09-11 label-threshold audit). The ladder was FOUR points — and one of them was
`opm_med_5y`, a 5-year MEDIAN standing in for the missing 5-years-back level. Four points is 6
pairs, so tau held only the thirteen multiples of 1/6; 0.25 was unreachable, the gate that READ
0.25 MEANT `tau >= 1/3`, and 692 stocks (25.5%) sat one OPM observation from flipping C or FADE.
That audit said the coarseness must NOT be "fixed" — because moat_tau already consumed every OPM
level column that existed. That was the only reason.

2026-09-19: the vendor's `OPM 3 Years Back` and `OPM 5 Years Back` arrived, both verified to be
what their names claim (lag decay vs `opm` 0.951 → 0.716 → 0.577; each correlates best with the
PAT/revenue-derived NPM of its OWN year; ≤0.1% identical to any level sibling). The ladder is
now FIVE true levels, oldest first: opm_5yb → opm_3yb → opm_1yb → opm → opm_latest_q. The median
left the ladder — a median is centred ~2.5 years back and is not a point in time.

WHAT CHANGED, MEASURED (company_id-aligned A/B on the 2,717-row vintage):
  * attainable values 13 → 27: multiples of 1/10 on the full ladder (79.8% of rows) and of 1/6
    on rows lacking one level (11.9%; they keep exactly min_pairs = 6). 0.25 is STILL unreachable
    (2dp: 0.20 / 0.30 / 0.17 / 0.33), so `>= 0.25` now means `>= 0.3` on tenths and `>= 1/3` on
    sixths — pinned below, because the constant's meaning is a function of this list.
  * the fragility is FINER, not gone: the step (0.1) still exceeds the gap to the cut (0.05), so
    one pair flip still crosses it; but a single OPM observation now touches 4 of 10 pairs (40%)
    where it touched 3 of 6 (50%). 604 stocks (24.3%) sit one step from a gate — 267 at +0.2,
    246 at −0.2, a handful at ±0.3 and the sixths.
  * the new ladder SPANS FIVE YEARS and the old one did not. Against a Kendall tau over the
    PAT/revenue-derived NPM of the same four years (columns the OPM ladder never touches) the
    new tau reads ρ +0.563 where the old read +0.353.

TWO CORRECTIONS TO THE ABOVE, MADE THE SAME DAY. Both are recorded rather than quietly edited,
because the first draft of this file argued the change was justified on evidence it did not have.

  1. THE WITNESS IS SPAN-MATCHING, NOT AN ACCURACY TEST, and the first draft used it as one.
     Re-run against NPM witnesses of three different spans, EACH LADDER WINS ITS OWN SPAN:
         witness 5Y (FY21,23,25,26):  OLD +0.353   NEW +0.563   A +0.315   -> NEW
         witness 3Y (FY23,25,26):     OLD +0.492   NEW +0.509   A +0.546   -> A
         witness 2Y (FY25,26):        OLD +0.447   NEW +0.315   A +0.440   -> OLD
     (A = [opm_3yb, opm_1yb, opm, opm_latest_q], the 4-rung variant.) So the witness cannot say
     which ladder is "more accurate" in general -- it says which SPAN each one measures. That
     turns the question into "which span is specified?", which has a written answer: the tile
     reads "Margin Trend (5Y Tau)" and verdict_engine's leg C is "the 5-year margin spine".
     Five years is the spec, and only this ladder delivers it -- the old ladder's oldest rung
     was a MEDIAN centred ~FY2024, so three of its four rungs sat inside ~18 months.

  2. A FORWARD TEST IS POSSIBLE AFTER ALL, AND THIS LADDER LOSES IT. The first draft said no
     forward test existed because the columns are in no earlier snapshot. That was wrong for one
     window: opm_3yb/opm_5yb are FIXED FISCAL-YEAR levels, and the fiscal year did NOT roll
     between the 2026-08-22 and 2026-09-19 snapshots (roll test 1.1%; every shared level matches
     92.8-99.6%), so today's values are what the August vintage carried and can be backfilled.
     Validated: recomputing the OLD ladder on that snapshot reproduces its stored moat_tau on
     100.0% of rows. Result, forward to 2026-09-19 (n=1818 common, corp actions excluded):
         OLD +0.1266   NEW +0.1106   A +0.1400
     P(NEW beats OLD) = 10.7%, bootstrap 90% CI [-0.0373, +0.0052]. Where the two ladders
     disagree on direction the OLD one is right (-4.57% vs a -2.08% universe). Window 1 CANNOT
     be reconstructed: the fiscal year rolled between June and August (June's opm = September's
     opm_1yb on 80.8%), so June's "3 years back" is FY2022, which exists in no column.

WHY IT SHIPS ANYWAY, stated so the next reader can overturn it with evidence rather than taste:
  (a) moat_tau's DIRECT consumer is wealth_tier leg C, which is price-blind BY DESIGN and
      documented as "a description, not a recommendation" -- describing the 5-year margin trend
      IS its job, and the tile's label claims exactly that span.
  (b) the only return-predictive consumer is trajectory_score -> win_rate_proxy -> Kelly, and it
      averages moat_tau with roce_tau/revenue_tau/pat_tau, so the IC cost arrives DILUTED 4:1
      while the span gain is undiluted.
  (c) one 28-day window with a CI straddling zero does not meet this repo's own bar (same sign
      in BOTH windows), and window 1 is unavailable.
DECEMBER'S RULE, PRE-DECLARED: if the new ladder loses again on a second window, the fix is NOT
to revert this measurement -- it is to give trajectory_score a shorter-span margin tau and leave
the 5Y one where the label says 5Y. Ladder A is the candidate; it won here but it was the best
of seven variants on a single window, which is a selection effect, not a result.

SETTLED BY THE SAME SWEEP, in BOTH windows: THE QUARTER RUNG IS LOAD-BEARING. Dropping
opm_latest_q costs -0.0251 (W1) and -0.0246 (W2) -- and W1 uses only columns native to the June
snapshot, so that half needs no backfill and no fiscal-year assumption. docs/known-issues.md had
this open as "test whether dropping opm_latest_q improves trajectory's predictive value"; the
answer is no, and the question is closed.
  * 568 wealth tiers (20.9%) were re-measured on the switch — BUY★ 336 → 331 (50 in / 46 out),
    N/A 369 → 441: the 154 stocks that LOST a tau are shallow-history firms (91.6% lack a 5-year
    PAT vs 17.3% of the universe; a third listed under two years ago) — a company without five
    years of margins gets no five-year margin trend. Unverifiable is not passed, nor condemned.
