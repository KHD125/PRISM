test_breakout_mode.py
=====================
Contract: the "Breakout" Analysis Mode — quality, momentum and breakout in EQUAL THIRDS — is
THE DEFAULT (config.DEFAULT_ANALYSIS_MODE), and every other mode is byte-identical to before
the third leg existed.

HOW IT GOT HERE (2026-09-19, all in one day). The user proposed blending the composite from
quality + momentum + breakout. Measured on both forward windows in EXACTLY the form the engine
computes (governance 15%, every framework boost, the governance shield and the forensic multiplier
all kept — NOT the bare rank blend, which flatters it):

    form                                   W1 06-17→08-22   W2 08-22→09-19
    Hybrid composite (current default)          +0.134           +0.034
    Q+M+B, engine form                          +0.148           +0.094      <- this mode
    Q+B,   engine form                          +0.148           +0.066
    Q+M,   engine form                          +0.139           +0.065
    quality_score alone                         +0.116           -0.025

It beats Hybrid in both windows and beats Q+M and Q+B; Q+B is 0.975-correlated with it.

PROMOTED TO DEFAULT THE SAME DAY (2026-09-19), which reversed the paragraph that stood here. The
original text argued it should wait for December because 28- and 66-day windows favour price
strength by construction. Two things changed that: (a) the 94-DAY window (06-17 -> 09-19) was
added — the longest we hold, 3x the short one — and the theory that the best quality weight RISES
with horizon got no support from it (its top-5 weightings carry 0% quality, same as at 28 days),
so the argument for waiting was a prior with no data behind it; and (b) a 66-point sweep of the
whole Q/M/B simplex showed Hybrid ranks #56/#60/#60 of 66 across the three windows — not merely
beaten but near the BOTTOM, with 14 of 21 quality-led weightings beating it in all three. The
default was indefensible on every horizon that can be measured.

WHAT IS KNOWINGLY GIVEN UP, since it is a hedge and not a measurement: breakout_score is already
40% of momentum_score, so the default now puts ~2/3 of the composite on price strength. The
remaining third keeps the fundamental work in the ranking against the horizon nobody can see yet
(the grid optimum wants 0% quality on ALL THREE windows — following it would not be PRISM).
DECEMBER IS A REVIEW, NOT A CORONATION: on the first 6-month window, a quality-led weighting that
beats thirds moves the default back. tools/validate.py reconstructs EVERY mode on EVERY snapshot
(composite_mode_*), so that comparison is apples-to-apples whatever mode each was taken under.
